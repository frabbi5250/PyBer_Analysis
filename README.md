# PyBer_Analysis
Analyzing data factors of a ridesharing company and creating compelling data visualizations.
## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to analyze the total weekly fares for each city type In order to accomplish this task, a multi-line graph was created and taken into consideration when analyzing each city type from three angles: urban, suburban, and rural. The following analysis were also taken into consideration: ride count, average fare per ride, and average number of drivers, all categorized by the type of city. Within this challenge, a summary data frame was created which includes organized total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver.

## Results
There is a trend between the population of the city and the total number of rides whcih explains the direct correlation with the total number of drivers, and total fare. The total number of rides, drivers and fares decrease as the cities are not within urbanized areas based on the accessibility of PyBer rides and drivers in rural areas. Less drivers in rural areas may lead to high average fares.

## Summary

The average fare per ride and driver is higher due to less drivers. As a result, the company can decrease or increase the number of drivers in order to achieve. to achieve its profit goal.
